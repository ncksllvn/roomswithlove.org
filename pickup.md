Donating your gently used furniture provides a __home__ for those starting over. To schedule
a pickup, please fill out the form below.

To continue providing this ministry to the community, we also ask for a __monetary
donation of $25 for pickups__ to help us cover gas and storage expenses.

_Please Note: we only pickup in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell Counties._

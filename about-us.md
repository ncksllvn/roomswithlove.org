Rooms With Love (RWL) is a furniture ministry that serves displaced individuals and/or families and makes their house a __home__.  RWL's mission is to help those starting over from homelessness and/or addiction in the Northern Kentucky by picking up new or gently used furniture and household items.

RWL began in 2020 as a ministry under Christ Chapel church and became a nonprofit organization in 2022.

RWL was featured in the [Neighbors of Union](/NeighborsOfUnion_Jan21-2.pdf) in January of 2020 after meeting the publisher during a pickup.

Rooms With Love (RWL) is a furniture ministry that serves those starting over from homelessness and/ or addiction in Northern Kentucky by picking up new or gently used furniture and household items.

RWL is a nonprofit ministry under [Christ's Chapel Church.](http://www.christschapel.net/)

RWL was featured in the [Neighbors of Union](/NeighborsOfUnion_Jan21-2.pdf) in January of 2020 after meeting the publisher during a pickup.
